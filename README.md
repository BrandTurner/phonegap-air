Put your web app in the App Store and update it whenever you want.

![Demo App](https://cldup.com/M5ZzPZAiEA-3000x3000.jpeg)

## Features

* Update any asset you want. HTML, CSS, JS, Fonts, Images, etc.
* Keep your app up-to-date even if the user hasn't launched it in a while
* Download only the smallest changeset needed to update a client
* Switch between prod/staging/dev versions of your app by shaking your device
* Make your app feel faster with cleverly used launch images

## Advanced Features

* Load images from the web instantly by proxying them to a local cache
* Deep link into your application

## Demo

Included is a working Xcode project and sample node.js server.

1. Open the Xcode project
2. Run it in the iOS simulator (pick any device)
3. Observe that a blocking update is performed using the production manifest
4. Select Hardware -> Shake Gesture to open the branch switcher
5. Select "Staging"
6. Observe that a blocking update was performed using the staging manifest

## Usage

* Configure the Xcode project
  * Hard-code your production and staging URLs in `Constants.m`
  * Create and add your launch images and app icons
  * Modify the shake gesture handler to restrict access to the dev tools
  * Set your product name and other target preferences
* Add a manifest to your web server
  * See the sample node.js server for how to do this

## Documentation

* How does the app know what to update?

The app requests a `manifest.json` file from your server with this syntax:

```json
{
  "files":{
    "app.js": {
      "checksum":"d8138338a247ec7ec1eb69c40dc554c2",
      "destination":"app.js",
      "source":"/app.js"
    }
  },
  "assets":["http://cdn.com/image.jpg"],
  "message":"A description of this version",
  "version":"1.0.0"
}
```

**files**

A dictionary of objects. The keys are for your own reference; the update system disregards them. `destination` refers to where in the `www` folder this file should be placed. `source` should be a path relative to your web server's root indicating where the

**assets**

An array of URLs to prime the app's cache with. The URLs themselves will be hashed, so if if you wish to change the content, you must provide a unique URL or existing clients will continue using the old data.

**message**

A description of this version of the app.

**version**

The version number of the app. Clients will update themselves if this increases.

See `ota-server/server.js` for an example.

* How do I restrict access to the dev tools?

Implement the global function `window.shouldAllowOTADevTools`. This function should return a boolean indicating if the dev tools should be opened.

* When does the app update?

1. On initial launch, an update is attempted before the app is started
2. When the app enters the background (e.g. when the home button is pushed)
3. When the device is plugged in and on wifi
4. When a selection is made in the dev panel

If an update finishes downloading while the app is in the foreground, it will only be applied when the user reopens the app.

## Support
